let isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
    console.log("Keep it up!");
} else {
    console.log("Pretty sure you are learning....");
}

Q1- What should the above code console.log?
ANS - it will console.log "Keep it up!";

Q2 -Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)? Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?
ANS - it is beacuse if block checks for boolean values by default, that is why we dont need to specify "isLearning === true"

---------------------------------

let firstvariable;
let secondvariable = "";
let thirdvariable = 1;
let secretMessage = "Shh!";

if(firstvariable){
    console.log("first");
} else if(firstvariable || secondvariable){
    console.log("second");
} else if(firstvariable || thirdvariable){
    console.log("third");
} else {
    console.log("fourth");
}

Q1 - What should the above code console.log? Why?
ANS  - it will console.log "third", because firstvariable is undefined(falsly), the first block 0f code will not run
        there is no variables that are truthy in the second block, while thirdvariable is truthy because it contains a string

Q2 - what is the value of firstvariable when it is initialized?
ANS - the value is undefined

Q3 - Is the value of firstvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
Ans - firstvariable is not truthy because the value is undefined

Q4 - Is the value of secondvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
Ans - secondvariable is not truthy because its value is an empty string

Q5. Is the value of thirdvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
Ans - thirdvariable is truthy because it contains a data type of number as its value;

Q6. What is a falsey value? List all the falsey values in JavaScript.

ANS- falsey values are values that are considered false when encountered in a boolean context

falsy values are
1. false
2. 0 (zero)
3. -0 (negative zero)
4. 0n (BigInt)
5. "" (empty string)
6. null (absense of any value)
7. undefined (undefined primitive value)
8. NaN (not a number)
